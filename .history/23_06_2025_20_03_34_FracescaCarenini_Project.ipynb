    "Video games are increasingly being used as platforms for research, offering rich data on user behaviour in interactive environments. A research group at UBC has set up a customized Minecraft server to study how players interact with the game world, logging detailed information about each player's characteristics and in-game activity. These data can help address practical challenges such as server capacity planning and targeted participant recruitment by identifying patterns in user engagement. In this project, we use data from the Minecraft server to investigate whether player characteristics—specifically gender and gaming experience—can predict how many hours a player spends on the server. To conduct our analysis, we use R to wrangle, clean, and visualize the data, and apply appropriate statistical models to answer our predictive question. The findings may provide insights that support more efficient resource allocation and outreach efforts for the research team."

    "        We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can\n",
    "        target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "From this question, I am interested in discovering if playing time (in hours) and age of a player can predict wether a player is subscribed, and if they can, use these predictions to help see which types of players are most likely to contribute the most data by being subscribed to minecraft and willing to pay to keep playing. I believe that age and playing time can be used ot predict subscription as they are two numerical variables that can be used as predictors by KNN classification."

    "In conclusion, this analysis has shown that age and playing time can be used to predict the subscription status of a player, however, I would say KNN classification might not be the best algorithm to predict this data as the scatter plot shows that there are many more subscribed players, and therefore the model tended to predict too many observations in the test data as true. In the future, I would have maybe added data points for the FALSE subscription status to make the KNN classification algorithm have a better effect. Overall, the accuracy of the model was 75%, which is not horrible, and the best K was chosen to be 21. When a new observation was given for the model to predict, it did a pretty good job, and its prediction aligns well with where the point lies on the scatterplot, as seen above.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that this conclusion is pretty similar to what I expected to find, as I predicted in the beginning that these two variables would be able to predict playing time; however, I was surprised that the accuracy of the model was a bit low even after tuning to find the best K.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the findings of this analysis could help the UBC computer science team in picking what demographic of age to pick for their studies, and cross-reference it with playing time to see what players are more likely to subscribe to the game and continue playing after the study. This could help them find players that are actually committed to continuing playing Minecraft; therefore, it answers the overarching problem of finding players that will keep giving the study the most amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis might help develop new questions, such as patterns between the other two numerical variables and discover them through the KNN classification algorithm. Furthermore, researchers could look more into unsupervised methods of analysis, such as asking if there are any subgroups within the data provided in this analysis, which could be approached using k-means clustering algorithm."
